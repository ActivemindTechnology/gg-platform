# Repo Conventions

## File Extension
Always prefer spinal-case (also named kebab-case or hyphen-separated) for file names and use snake_case only if it contributes to a better understanding of the content.

Incorrect Code Example
```
winterSeason.md
IceCold.md
snow fall.md
```
Recommended Code Example
